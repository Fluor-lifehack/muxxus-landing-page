    {
      question: "What is the Muxxus Bill Pay Solution and how does it work?",
      answer: "A bill pay solution allows you to manage multiple steps required to pay vendor invoices and bills. This includes uploading bills and extracting the relevant data, routing bills to the appropriate team members for approval prior to payment, making the payment to the vendor, and reconciling the bill and payment data. Muxxus's bill pay solution reduces hours spent in multiple tools by consolidating all of these processes into one, easy-to use workflow for both domestic and international bills, while reducing errors associated with manual tasks."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I set up custom approval workflows?",
      answer: "Custom approval workflows can easily be set up by admins according to the bill's amount and currency. Approvers can be set to the user's specific manager, specific roles, or specific users and multiple layers of approvers can be set within each workflow to ensure the right team members are reviewing spend."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I integrate Muxxus's bill pay solution with my accounting software?",
      answer: "Muxxus is integrated with Netsuite, Xero and Quickbooks. With these integrations you can import invoices directly to pay in Muxxus or code invoices created in Muxxus with your chart of accounts data. You can also sync invoices and their payments back to your accounting software for faster reconciliation."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is the bill pay platform?",
      answer: "We provide enterprise-level security including multi-factor authentication, approval workflows, audit trails, and compliance with international security standards. All vendor data and payment information is encrypted and securely stored."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pay bills in multiple currencies?",
      answer: "Yes, you can pay bills in multiple currencies at market-leading FX rates. The platform automatically handles currency conversion and you can pay vendors across 200+ countries without manual bank transfers."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I process and pay bills?",
      answer: "Bills can be processed and paid within 24-48 hours depending on approval workflows. For urgent payments, we offer expedited processing. All payments are tracked in real-time with instant notifications."
