  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is an international corporate business card?",
      answer: "An international corporate business card is a Visa payment card you can use to make payments in multiple foreign currencies from balances in your associated business account. Muxxus Corporate cards are multi-currency cards that enable your employees to make purchases in multiple currencies from held balances in your Muxxus Wallet. This can be useful in eliminating costly and unnecessary currency conversion fees on international spend."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I use a company card vs an employee card?",
      answer: "Company cards are good for business purchases that are typically made online and on behalf of the entire company or specific teams and departments. This could include purchases such as software subscriptions, office supplies, supplier payments, and marketing expenses. Employee cards are great for individual employee purchases either made online or in person, such as travel expenses like airfare or hotels and incidental purchases like coffee or snacks."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of an international corporate business debit card?",
      answer: "Businesses paying for goods and services in more than one currency can benefit from the reduced fees associated with a multi-currency card. With Muxxus Borderless Cards, you can pay for domestic and international purchases directly from held currency balances in your Muxxus Wallet, eliminating unnecessary FX conversion fees. You'll also benefit from 0% foreign card transaction fees and no hidden charges."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure are your corporate cards?",
      answer: "We provide enterprise-level security including real-time fraud detection, spending limits, merchant restrictions, instant card freezing, multi-factor authentication, and compliance with international security standards like PCI DSS."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set different spending limits for different employees?",
      answer: "Yes, you can customize spending limits for each card based on employee role, department, or project. Set daily, weekly, or monthly limits, and restrict spending to specific merchant categories or geographic locations."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I get new cards issued?",
      answer: "New corporate cards can be issued within 24-48 hours. For urgent requests, we offer expedited processing. All cards come with instant activation and can be used immediately upon receipt."
